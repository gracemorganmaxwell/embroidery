# Embroidery Hobby Website

## Introduction
This project is a personal website dedicated to the art of embroidery. It showcases various aspects of embroidery, from basic techniques to modern applications. The site is designed to be informative, visually appealing, and user-friendly, with a focus on responsive design and interactive elements.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling the web pages, including layout design, responsive design techniques, and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity to the web pages, specifically for the theme toggle feature.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices of various sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle:** An interactive button allows users to switch between dark and light themes, enhancing accessibility and user preference.
- **Interactive Gallery:** The embroidery gallery utilizes CSS grid for layout and includes hover effects for image scaling, offering an engaging way to view embroidery projects.

## Development Methodologies
- **Mobile-First Design:** The development process started with designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up to larger screens, ensuring optimal usability and performance on mobile devices.
  
- **CSS Best Practices:** Employed methodologies such as the use of custom properties (variables), media queries for responsive design, and transitions for smooth animations.
- **Semantic HTML:** Used semantic HTML tags to structure the content meaningfully, improving SEO and accessibility.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Implemented event listeners for interactive elements, such as the theme toggle button, to enhance the user experience through dynamic content changes.

## Project Structure
- The HTML file structures the content and includes meta tags for responsiveness and SEO.
- The CSS is embedded within the HTML file for simplicity, focusing on responsive design, theming, and animations.
- JavaScript is used to add functionality to the theme toggle button, allowing users to switch between dark and light modes.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Responsive Images:** Ensured images scale appropriately using CSS, providing a fluid experience in the gallery section.
- **Theme Consistency:** Implemented a JavaScript toggle function to switch themes while maintaining user preferences across page reloads (conceptual solution, actual implementation may require local storage or cookies).

## Future Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns:** Refactor the project to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files for better maintainability.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Improve accessibility by adding aria-labels and role attributes where applicable.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize images and leverage caching strategies for improved loading times.
