      <h1>🪡🧵 What is Embroidery?</h1>
      <h2>My favourite type of crafting</h2>
      <p>
        Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials using a
        needle to apply thread or yarn. Embroidery may also incorporate other
        materials such as pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. In modern days,
        embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, overlays, blankets,
        dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, scarfs, and golf shirts.
        Embroidery is available in a wide variety of thread or yarn colour. It
        is often used to personalize gifts or clothing items. Some of the basic
        techniques or stitches of the earliest embroidery are chain stitch,
        buttonhole or blanket stitch, running stitch, satin stitch, and cross
        stitch.Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand
        embroidery today.
